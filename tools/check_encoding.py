"""Guard against the file-name display-encoding defect class (feature 042).

A file name is stored as UTF-8 everywhere in this application.  It is destroyed
only at the last step before it is drawn, and it goes wrong in exactly two ways:

  * LOSSY        - the name is converted down to the machine's legacy codepage,
                   so every character that codepage cannot hold becomes '?'.
                   One '?' per UTF-16 code unit, so one emoji costs two.
  * UNINTERPRETED- the name's UTF-8 bytes are drawn as if they were legacy text,
                   so 'c' with caron becomes two mojibake characters.

Both were reported by users, twice, on different surfaces.  This script exists so
the third occurrence fails the build instead of reaching someone's screen.

Rules
-----
cp-acp-display   A name is converted with WideCharToMultiByte(CP_ACP, ...) on a
                 path that ends in a display.  Lossy by construction: forbidden.

mixed-composition
                 A printf-family call whose FORMAT comes from LoadStr() (legacy
                 codepage) and whose arguments include a file name (UTF-8), with
                 the result handed to a message box.  The composed string is then
                 not valid UTF-8, so CMessageBox refuses its own wide drawing
                 path and falls back to the legacy one - which renders the
                 template correctly and the name as mojibake.
                 NOTE: an English build cannot reproduce this.  English resources
                 are pure ASCII, ASCII is valid UTF-8, so the composed string
                 converts cleanly and looks correct.  Only localized builds show
                 it.  That is why this rule is static rather than a runtime test.

ansi-template-number
                 A grouped number composed with an ANSI LoadStr() template
                 (feature 067).  NumberToStr()/PrintDiskSize() output carries
                 the UTF-8 locale thousands separator (feature 041), so an
                 ANSI template makes the composed string invalid UTF-8 and a
                 Sal*U8 sink draws it through the legacy path - the Czech
                 no-break-space separator renders as "A-circumflex + space".
                 Two shapes: a printf-family call whose format is LoadStr()
                 and whose arguments call NumberToStr()/PrintDiskSize()
                 directly, and ExpandPluralString() fed a LoadStr() bytes-
                 plural template (those templates receive a grouped number by
                 construction).  Use LoadStrU8(), or PrintDiskSize(..., TRUE).

dead-dispinfow   A dialog handles LVN_GETDISPINFOW but never sends NF_REQUERY.
                 Such a handler can never run: a list view asks its parent for a
                 notification format during its own creation, which is before
                 WM_INITDIALOG, and CDialog::CDialogProc only attaches the dialog
                 object at WM_INITDIALOG.  The query therefore goes unanswered,
                 DefDlgProc replies from IsWindowUnicode(parent) - FALSE for every
                 dialog here - and the control settles on ANSI permanently.
                 This rule would have caught the reported Find defect on the day
                 the handler was written.

Draft rules (feature 068, report-only, `--draft`)
-------------------------------------------------
The product-wide encoding review (specs/068-encoding-regression-review)
found fourteen defect classes with no guard at all.  The rules below describe
the ones a regex can see.  They run ONLY with --draft, never in the strict
build gate, until the review has classified their hits and annotated the
legitimate ones; a rule is then promoted into RULES (see the review report).

ansi-api-on-utf8-path
                 A UTF-8 name or path (an identifier that holds one by
                 convention, or the result of a known UTF-8 producer) passed
                 to an un-suffixed - i.e. ANSI - Win32 file/shell/process/
                 registry call.  The core is built without UNICODE, so
                 CreateFile( is CreateFileA(.  Features 058, 062 and 063 each
                 fixed instances of this shape; nothing enforced it.  Use the
                 Sal* facade (src/common/salfileio.h) or SalU8ToW + the W call.

cp-acp-utf8-source
                 MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, ...) applied to a UTF-8 value -
                 the narrow-to-wide mirror of cp-acp-display (features 058 and
                 062).  The else-branch of a SalU8ToW attempt is not flagged.

ansi-tooltip-handler
                 An ANSI TTN_NEEDTEXT / TTN_GETDISPINFO handler that composes
                 UTF-8 text into its ANSI szText (feature 067, viewer offset
                 tooltip).  Register the tool with TOOLINFOW/TTM_ADDTOOLW and
                 handle the W notification.

strict-probe-rejects-wtf8
                 A raw MultiByteToWideChar(CP_UTF8, MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS, ...)
                 probe outside salunicode.cpp.  Since feature 066 internal names
                 are WTF-8; a raw strict probe misroutes a surrogate-bearing
                 name into the ANSI branch.  Probe with SalU8ToW instead, or
                 mark a non-name site as reviewed.

lossy-lenient-at-intake
                 A lenient WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, ...) conversion, or
                 a SalU8ToWDisplay result handed to an operational call (file,
                 registry, process).  U+FFFD baked into a name destroys its
                 identity (feature 066).

acp-byte-table-on-name
                 A 256-entry ACP byte table (LowerCase[], IsAlpha[], ...)
                 indexed by a byte of a UTF-8 name: every byte >= 0x80 - all
                 of UTF-8 - is folded through the active code page, so two
                 spellings of one accented name compare unequal while
                 unrelated accented letters compare equal (cluster B-2).

                 Feature 069 narrowed this rule: it used to also flag a name
                 byte compared as a control character through a *signed* char,
                 a premise that is void - the product compiles with /J, so
                 plain char is unsigned (feature 068, ledger L07).

acp-title-seed    A translated string seeded through the ANSI LoadStr into a
                 configuration field whose consumers read it as UTF-8: the
                 packer/unpacker titles (SetPacker/SetUnpacker) and the built-in
                 view-mode names (CViewTemplates::Set).  LoadStr substitutes "?"
                 for every character the active code page cannot express, and the
                 damaged value is then persisted (feature 069, F-P4-03/F-P4-07).
                 Use LoadStrU8 at the seed.

missed-twin      LoadStr(IDS_X) where IDS_X is already loaded with LoadStrU8
                 somewhere else.  The remaining ANSI twin is either composed
                 with UTF-8 (the feature 067 zip.cpp defect) or genuinely
                 ANSI-only - either way it must be decided, not overlooked.

Suppressing a finding
---------------------
Put a marker on the offending line or the line above it:

    // encoding-check: allow <rule-id> - <reason>

The reason is mandatory and is what a future reader will be judged on.  Blanket
suppression of a whole file is deliberately not supported.

Usage

    python tools/check_encoding.py --strict     # exit 1 if anything is found
