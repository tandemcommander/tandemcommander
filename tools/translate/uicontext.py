"""Context for the machine translator: *where* a UI string is used.

Sending a bare label like ``Host:`` or ``&New`` to a translation engine loses
the only thing that decides the right word. DeepL rendered ``Host:`` as the
Czech "Moderátor" (a talk-show host), ``Key file`` as "Klíčový" (the adjective
"key", cut off), and ``&New`` as "Novinka" (a news item) -- each defensible for
the isolated word and wrong for a dialog field in an SFTP client.

Everything needed to fix that is already in the repository: the ``.slt``
carries the dialog/menu/string-table each row belongs to, and the module's
``.rh`` files name every control. ``IDT_HOSTADDRESS`` says "static label for a
host address", ``IDB_NEWBOOKMARK`` says "button that creates a new bookmark".
This module turns that into an English sentence per section, which is passed to
the engine as translation context (context is guidance only -- it is never
itself translated).

Context is built per section rather than per row so a dialog needs one request
instead of one per control, and so the engine also sees the *neighbouring*
labels, which is what disambiguates a one-word button.
