// The plug-in lists a multi-session image with one folder per session and a
// single-session one by its last data track (falling back to the other
// tracks when that one does not open). A track that did not open was skipped
// without marking the listing (feature 328's "incomplete" mark, which makes a
// whole unpack fail), and a data track lying past the end of the image was
// taken as a raw data track that lists nothing - Unpack with "Delete archive
// after unpacking" then deleted the image and the files of that track.

//     holds the earlier sessions' files); a raw data track that can be read (a Video CD's MPEG track)
//     is not marked either.
//   - an audio track: always - the plug-in never extracts audio (a whole unpack skips it silently),
//     listed or not (review 1: a data + audio disc lost its audio tracks).
//   - an unknown track: always - no listing ever shows it (review 1).
//   - a kind or an outcome this rule does not know: marked (fails closed).
