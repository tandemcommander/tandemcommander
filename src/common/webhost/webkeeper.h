// webkeeper.h - session keeper for the shared WebView2 browser tree.
//
// Lifted out of src/plugins/mdview/webview.cpp by feature 070
// (contracts/webview-host-sharing.md S1; original design and invariants:
//  specs/065-mdview-instant-render/contracts/keeper.md).
//
// The keeper holds one hidden, suspended controller so the shared browser
// process tree never shuts down between viewer windows. Any ONE live
// controller keeps the tree warm for every consumer, so whichever plugin the
// user reaches first warms the others -- but each plugin arms its OWN keeper
// at its OWN first use, never earlier (065 FR-001: zero background work and
// zero footprint before the plugin's first real use).
//
// Everything here is MAIN-THREAD-ONLY (the main message loop dispatches the
// async completions), idempotent, and silent on every failure path: a keeper
// that cannot arm simply leaves the next view to pay the cold start.
