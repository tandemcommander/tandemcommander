# Tandem Commander — Project Context

## What Is This?

Tandem Commander is a two-panel file manager for Windows, derived from
Open Salamander (open-sourced under GPLv2 in 2023). It is a pure
WinAPI C++ application — no MFC, no Qt, no cross-platform frameworks.

## Product Identity (established in feature 032, renamed in feature 046)

- **Product name**: Tandem Commander, version **0.1.7** (internal build 191);
  released versions and what changed in each are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`
  (mandatory per the constitution: a release bumps
  `VERSINFO_SALAMANDER_MINORB` + `VERSINFO_BUILDNUMBER` in
  `src/plugins/shared/spl_vers.h`, `MyAppVersion` in
  `setup/tandemcommander.iss`, and this line, in the same change as the
  changelog entry; the plugin interface version
  `LAST_VERSION_OF_SALAMANDER` is independent and changes only with the
  plugin API). Version 0.1.0 was the first public release;
  known as Newt Commander before feature 046 — the rename covered every
  user/OS-visible surface, kernel-object/IPC names, URLs, translations and the
  installer (new AppId), with **no** config import from the old registry root
- **Binary**: `tandemcommander.exe` (set via `<TargetName>` in `salamand.vcxproj`)
- **Registry root**: `HKCU\Software\Tandem Commander\0.1` — never reads or
  writes Open Salamander/Altap/Newt Commander registry keys (no config import)
- **Websites**: https://tandemcommander.org · repo github.com/tandemcommander/tandemcommander
- **Copyright rule**: years up to 2026 → "Open Salamander Authors",
  2026 onward → **Pavel Stupka** (sftp+mdview plugins are solely his).
  The holder name is defined **once**, as `VERSINFO_HOLDER_TANDEM` in
  `src/plugins/shared/spl_vers.h`; every notice concatenates it
  (`"… , © 2026 " VERSINFO_HOLDER_TANDEM`) and never spells it out — that
  covers all 30 `versinfo.rh2` files, the standalone `.rc` files
  (salmon, shellext, zip sfx trio, fcremote, salpvenv) and the two
  hardcoded strings in `plugins2.cpp` / `zip/add_del.cpp`. The two
  notices shown in the About dialog and on the splash screen live in
  `src/versinfo.rh2` (`VERSINFO_COPYRIGHT_TANDEM` above
  `VERSINFO_COPYRIGHT_OPENSAL`) and are never translated — the About
  controls carry an empty caption in `lang.rc`. Do not look for this
  text in the language files (feature 040).
- **IMPORTANT**: source files, functions, classes, project/solution names
  (`salamand.sln`, `salamand.vcxproj`, `SALAMANDER_*` constants) deliberately
  keep their upstream names — rename only user/OS-visible identity
- **Brand assets**: `tools/brand/` — hand-swappable sources (feature 035):
  `icon-master.png` (+ optional `icon-<N>.png` overrides) → all shipped
  `.ico`; `about.png` → `src/res/logo.png` (About + splash artwork);
  `python tools/brand/gen_icons.py` regenerates everything, see
  `tools/brand/README.md`

## Technology

- **Language**: C++ (C++20, `/std:c++latest`)
- **Compiler**: MSVC v143 (Visual Studio 2022)
- **Platform**: Windows 11+, pure WinAPI
- **Build system**: MSBuild (`.sln` / `.vcxproj` / `.props`)
- **Plugin format**: `.spl` (plugin DLL) + `.slg` (language resource)

## Build Quick Start

```batch
set OPENSAL_BUILD_DIR=D:\Build\OpenSal\
build.cmd                       :: Debug x64 incremental build (from repo root)
build.cmd rebuild               :: Full clean + rebuild Debug x64
build.cmd full                  :: Complete build: also copies runtime data
                                ::   (convert tables, toolbars, scripts) and
                                ::   generates plugins\plugins.ver so all
                                ::   enabled plugins auto-register in
                                ::   Plugin Manager
build.cmd full release          :: Complete Release x64 build
```

**Plugin build policy**: `plugins.cfg` in the repository root decides
which plugins are compiled and shipped (`name=on|off`, one line per
plugin; currently 20 on / 11 off). Every `build.cmd` run validates the
file, builds only enabled plugins (via a generated solution filter
`src\vcxproj\salamand.gen.slnf`, gitignored), and removes outputs of
disabled plugins. See `specs/007-plugin-build-policy/`.

**Language build policy**: `translations/languages.cfg` decides which
languages are built and shipped — each `[folder]` section carries
`enabled = on|off`, the language counterpart of `plugins.cfg`. Every
`build.cmd` run validates the registry and reconciles the output tree
(any `.slg` not belonging to an enabled language is deleted from `lang\`
and `plugins\*\lang\`); language modules are *produced* only on a full
build. Currently 8 of 11 enabled — Simplified Chinese, Russian and
Ukrainian are off pending a menu rendering defect; their translation
source is retained, so re-enabling is one line. Authoring tools skip
disabled languages by default (`translate.merge --language <folder>` is
the opt-in). See `specs/039-language-build-policy/`.

Alternative scripts in `src\vcxproj\`: `build.cmd` (simple), `rebuild.cmd` (interactive menu) — these build the full solution and ignore `plugins.cfg`.

**Prerequisites**:
- Windows 11 or newer
- Visual Studio 2022 (Community, Professional, or Enterprise)
- "Desktop development with C++" workload installed in VS2022
- Windows 10/11 SDK (any version; projects use `10.0` = latest installed)
- Environment variable `OPENSAL_BUILD_DIR` (optional — defaults to `.\build\`)

## Key Facts

- **82 projects** in salamand.sln (1 main app, 31 plugins, 32 lang
  modules, 7 helper libs, 5 utilities, 2 shell exts, 3 setup, 1 other)
- **Plugin set is policy-driven**: 8 obsolete plugins were removed in
  feature 007 (pak, unarj, unlha, unfat, wmobile, ieviewer, splitcbn,
  winscp); `plugins.cfg` disables 10 more by default (demos and
  marginal plugins), so a default build ships 20 plugins
- **All dependencies are embedded** — zero NuGet packages
- **Visual C++ runtime ships with the product** (feature 077):
  `build.cmd release` copies `vcruntime140/vcruntime140_1/msvcp140/concrt140`
  from the located VS installation into the tree root and
  `tools/check_runtime_deps.py` proves every shipped module's runtime
  imports resolve there; the signing sweep leaves Microsoft's signature on
  them. Plugin authors: toolset no newer than the shipped runtime.
- **Missing deps**: unrar.dll (unrar), OpenSSL (ftp); pictview runs on
  the built-in Windows WIC engine since feature 006 (no pvw32cnv.dll
  needed)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8-BOM, formatted with clang-format
- **Comments**: Legacy Czech OK, new comments in English
- **Debug builds** use fixed base addresses (no ASLR) for leak detection
- **Release builds** use LTO/WPO and code signing

## Compiler Recommendation

- **Primary**: MSVC 2022 (full compatibility, zero effort)
- **Secondary CI**: Clang-cl (catches extra bugs, MSBuild-compatible)
- **Not viable**: MinGW-w64 (no x86 SEH, no MSBuild)

## Plugin Build Pattern

Each plugin: `plugins/<name>/vcxproj/<name>.vcxproj` → outputs `<name>.spl`
Each language: `plugins/<name>/vcxproj/lang_<name>.vcxproj` → outputs `english.slg`
Property sheets: `plugins/shared/vcxproj/plugin_base.props` + debug/release variants

## Branching Strategy

- **`main`** — upstream/stable branch
- **`ai-main`** — main branch for AI-assisted development
- Feature branches (e.g., `003-speckit-review`) are created from and merged into `ai-main`

## What To Work On Next

`specs/NEXT-WORK.md` is the single entry point for continuing work — a
consolidated, prioritized ordering of the per-feature handoffs
(`specs/069-finish-encoding-fixes/REMAINING-WORK.md`,
`specs/070-source-viewer-plugin/REMAINING-WORK.md`,
`specs/072-winget-distribution/REMAINING-WORK.md`), which stay authoritative
for the detail and the reasoning behind each item. Start there rather than
re-deriving the order from the individual files.

## Constitution

Project principles are in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
("Tandem Commander Constitution", v3.0.0): build reproducibility,
backward compatibility (baseline Tandem Commander 0.1.0 — the break
with Open Salamander 5.0 was made in feature 032, the Newt→Tandem
rename in feature 046; both deliberate, documented, one-time),
incremental modernization, Windows platform commitment,
plugin architecture preservation, UI consistency.

<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS END -->

## Active Technologies
- Windows Batch script (.cmd) + MSBuild (from VS2022), vswhere.exe (002-msvc-x64-build-script)
- C++ (C++20, `/std:c++latest`), MSVC v143 (VS2022) + Pure WinAPI (no frameworks); internal shared libs (`src/common/`); no new external dependencies (004-long-paths-unicode)
- Windows Registry for configuration (`REG_SZ` string values); NTFS/exFAT/FAT/network file systems as managed objects (004-long-paths-unicode)
- Translation data: `translations/<language>/<module>.slt` UTF-8-BOM text archives, committed; consumed at build time by `translator.exe` quiet modes to produce `<language>.slg` (038-translations-build-integration)
- Python 3.13 (`tools/`, `pyproject.toml`) + `anthropic` SDK for offline machine translation — developer-side only, never invoked by the build (038-translations-build-integration)
- Language build policy: `translations/languages.cfg` `enabled = on|off` per language; validated and reconciled by `src/vcxproj/lang_policy.ps1` on every `build.cmd` run (039-language-build-policy)
- Code signing: `tools/codesign/codesign.cfg` (committed profile: certificate SHA-1 thumbprint + Certum timestamp URL) consumed by `tools/codesign/sign_release.ps1` (Windows PowerShell 5.1 sweep, idempotent) and `setup/build_setup.cmd`; signtool.exe from the Windows SDK; Inno Setup 7 for the installer (050-code-signing)
- SFTP plugin: vendored libssh2 1.11.1_DEV (`src/common/dep/libssh2`) on the WinCNG backend (`LIBSSH2_WINCNG` + `LIBSSH2_ECDSA_WINCNG` — RSA/ECDSA only, no ed25519, no OpenSSL); test harness `src/plugins/sftp/test/` runs against a local Docker reference server (container `tandem-sftp`, localhost:2222) (051-fix-sftp-keyauth-hang)
- **WebView2 shared-engine contract** — MANDATORY for any plugin embedding
  WebView2 (planned: formatted source viewer, WebGPU), see
  `architecture/11-webview2-integration.md`: one canonical user data folder
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tandem Commander\WebView2` (a different UDF spawns a
  separate cold browser tree), one browser-arguments set built by the shared
  options helper in `src/plugins/mdview/webview.cpp` (later environments'
  args are silently ignored — extensions are coordinated helper changes,
  never per-plugin overrides), per-controller security stays per-plugin,
  and each plugin arms its own session-long keeper at its own first use
  (any one live controller keeps the warm tree for all). SDK vendored at
  `src/common/dep/webview2/` (v1.0.4078.44); second consumer lifts the
  helper to `src/common/` instead of copying it (065-mdview-instant-render)

## Recent Changes
- 002-msvc-x64-build-script: Added Windows Batch script (.cmd) + MSBuild (from VS2022), vswhere.exe
- 038-translations-build-integration: 12 shipped languages (English + 10 existing + new machine-translated Ukrainian) x 20 enabled modules; `.slt` import is strictly positional, so translation source is always regenerated from a current-structure English template
- 039-language-build-policy: which languages ship is now a committed policy (`enabled = on|off` in `translations/languages.cfg`), honoured by the build on every run; 3 non-Latin-script languages disabled pending a menu rendering defect, source retained
- 046-tandem-commander-rebrand: product renamed Newt Commander → Tandem Commander (`tandemcommander.exe`, registry root `HKCU\Software\Tandem Commander\0.1`, TandemCommander*/TCExten_* kernel/IPC names, tandemcommander.org, new installer AppId, new icon/artwork from `tools/brand/`); no config migration; upstream `salamand*`/`SALAMANDER_*` names retained
- 050-code-signing: on-demand release signing — `build.cmd full release sign [setup]` signs all shipped PE artifacts (exe/dll/spl/slg, ~206 files) via idempotent sweep `tools/codesign/sign_release.ps1` + compiles a signed Inno Setup installer (`setup/build_setup.cmd [sign]`, `#ifdef SIGN` in the .iss); default builds never sign (per-target hook `sign_with_retry.cmd` is a no-op unless `TC_CODESIGN=1`); Release trees no longer contain `.pdb/.lib/.exp` (redirected to `obj\` by `src/Directory.Build.targets`, cleaned + installer-excluded as safety nets)
- 052-fix-plugin-name-encoding: Plugins Manager showed mojibake names of
  not-loaded plugins in non-English UI. Root cause: `CPluginData::Name` had no
  defined encoding — CP1250 from a loaded plugin (`LoadStringA`) but UTF-8 from
  the feature-004 registry facade — and the name column used the ANSI listview
  call. Fix: plugin metadata is **UTF-8 by contract** (normalized at intake via
  `SalLegacyToU8Alloc`, see `specs/052-.../contracts/plugin-metadata-encoding.md`),
  name column renders via `SalListViewSetItemTextU8`, 15 mixed-composition
  sites converted to `LoadStrU8`, `tools/check_encoding.py` tracks the contract
  identifiers, **`build.cmd` now fails when python is missing** (guard can't be
  silently skipped). ZIP plugin renamed to literal "ZIP" in all languages
  (was machine-translated as "postal code" in cs/sk/fr/es/zh), pinned in
  `translations/ui-overrides.json`. No registry migration — stored values were
  verified intact; the defect was display-only.
- 056-prerelease-review: release gate for **0.1.2** (build 186, released
  2026-08-07). Multi-agent review (6 independent perspectives — memory,
  concurrency, network security, credentials, encoding, tooling/data — with
  adversarial verification) over the whole `v0.1.1..HEAD` delta (features
  052–055). All four code-safety perspectives judged the delta itself clean;
  the only shipped-product regression was F1 (SFTP: Duplicate on the now-transient
  Quick Connect row produced an empty bookmark — `dialogs.cpp` gates it on
  `isBookmark` like Save/Rename/Delete). Deferred, non-shipping: a dev-only
  `addrows.py` bug left the 3 disabled languages' `sftp.slt` 5 rows short (fix
  before re-enabling them); pre-existing `plugins1.cpp` fixed-buffer patterns.
  Gates G1–G9 green (full Debug+Release build, saltests 1145/0, SFTP harness
  7/7 + leak check, key-format fixtures 66/0, slt round-trip, cs+en smoke,
  version sweep). Report: `specs/056-prerelease-review/review-report.md`.
- 055-contextual-retranslation: every machine-provenance UI string outside the
  SFTP plugin (≈3,300 entries, 8 enabled languages × 19 modules) re-translated
  with usage context — the feature-051 method applied product-wide. Tooling:
  `translate.merge --redo-machine` (demotes all `machine` `.origin` entries to
  gaps; human/skip untouched by construction) + repeatable `--exclude-module`;
  `uicontext._DOMAINS` now covers all 20 enabled modules. Latent pipeline
  defects fixed: translations identical to their English were re-sent to DeepL
  on every run (match.py now trusts the sidecar), `dedupe_accelerators` was
  exponential on salamand's large menus (proper Kuhn visited-set sharing:
  >4 min → 0.3 s per language) **and rewrote accelerators inside human
  translations** (human/skip rows are now frozen obstacles), overrides that
  matched the engine's output lost their `human` provenance, contexts were
  built 16× instead of once. 20 pins added to `ui-overrides.json` (mdview
  View-menu strings across 7 languages, theme names, plugin name). Run cost
  52,728 DeepL chars; verification: provenance-scoped diff over 59,360
  entries proves human/skip entries byte-identical (0 violations); details in
  `specs/055-contextual-retranslation/run-notes.md`.
- 051-fix-sftp-keyauth-hang: fixed whole-app freeze on private-key connect. Root cause was in vendored libssh2: `_libssh2_pem_parse_memory`'s scan loops never terminate when the expected PEM marker is absent (`readline_memory` cannot signal EOF), and the WinCNG in-memory loader only understood classic RSA/DSA PEM — so an OpenSSH-container key (ssh-keygen's default since OpenSSH 7.8) spun the CPU forever on the UI thread. Patched pem.c (bounds guards, documented in `src/common/dep/libssh2/readme.txt` "Local patches"), added openssh-key-v1 RSA/ECDSA import + classic-PEM passphrase decryption to the WinCNG memory path, real libssh2 error codes on key-load failures. Plugin side: connect runs on a worker thread with a cancellable wait window (prompts stay on the UI thread via a `cpHostKey`/`cpPassphrase`/`cpPassword` retry handshake), the socket stays non-blocking so libssh2's timeout is actually enforced, key-format gate rejects PKCS#8/ed25519/.ppk up front, error classification by code (not message substrings), password fallback on a server-rejected key, dead-transport detection + reconnect, cancellable F3 download. Test harness reworked onto the product's `publickey_frommemory` path with a hang watchdog (`test/run_keyauth.cmd`, 7 scenarios) plus key-format fixtures in `test/build_and_run.cmd`
- 058-fix-cloud-status-icons: three feature-004 regressions-by-omission
  garbled the UTF-8 panel path in code still treating it as ANSI, breaking
  every folder whose path contains non-ASCII characters (e.g. Google Drive's
  `G:\Můj disk`): no cloud sync-status overlay badges (icon-reader wide
  prefix converted via CP_ACP, `fileswn1.cpp`), generic file icons
  (`SHILCreateFromPath` CP_ACP, `geticon.cpp`), and silently dead
  auto-refresh causing a busy-cursor re-list on every window activation
  (ANSI `FindFirstChangeNotification` in `snooper.cpp`, 3 sites). All three
  converted to the house pattern `SalU8ToW`/`SalU8ToWAlloc` + CP_ACP
  fallback (legacy plugin callers of `GetFileIcon` keep working); new W
  overload in the HANDLES layer. The provider was never the trigger — ASCII
  OneDrive paths worked all along. Contract:
  `specs/058-fix-cloud-status-icons/contracts/path-encoding-icon-pipeline.md`.
- 066-fix-surrogate-filenames: files with unpaired UTF-16 surrogates in the
  name (legal on NTFS, e.g. `Lone<U+D800>surrogate.txt`) could not be deleted,
  copied, moved, renamed or viewed — the feature-004 intake
  (`SalConvertFindDataW`) substituted U+FFFD on the strict-conversion failure,
  so every operation recomposed a nonexistent path. Fix: the house converter
  pair `SalWToU8`/`SalU8ToW` is **WTF-8** — `SalWToU8` is total (a lone
  surrogate encodes as its 3-byte sequence `ED A0 80..ED BF BF`), `SalU8ToW`
  additionally accepts exactly those sequences and still rejects every other
  malformed input (the "valid UTF-8, else ANSI" heuristics depend on that);
  byte-identical to UTF-8 for all valid Unicode names. Display
  (`SalU8ToWDisplay`, `CStaticText::SetText`) decodes to the true unit
  (Explorer-parity notdef glyph). WTF-8-aware probes: registry facade both
  directions (`SalRegQueryValueExW8` read side had been *lenient* — stored
  surrogate values loaded as U+FFFD), `CopyTextToClipboardU8`,
  `SalLegacyToU8Alloc`; the F8 recycle-list build in `fileswn8.cpp` converted
  leniently and was the one residual operational site. Contract:
  `specs/066-fix-surrogate-filenames/contracts/name-encoding-wtf8.md`;
  saltests 1221/0 incl. a real-NTFS facade round trip (`TestWtf8FileOps`).
- 069-finish-encoding-fixes: implemented the contained remainder the 068 review
  handed off — **31 of its 34 confirmed findings fixed** plus D01–D05, in 11
  groups, one commit each. Three items were **already fixed** and are recorded
  verify-closed (F-P1-03 by X06/X07, F-P2-10 by X02 — it is the same site as
  F-P6-02, found twice by two perspectives — and the jump-list half of F-P1-25
  by X03), and five site references in the findings proved stale, so every task
  now begins with a "still defective at HEAD?" check. Highlights: the command
  line inserts the name you see (six lines at the sink — the control already
  writes and reads its text through the wide house helpers, so no selection
  offset, word-break callback or `WM_CHAR` unit moves; a name outside the code
  page now inserts as `?`, which needs the Unicode control of cluster B-1);
  Compare Directories, the archive-edit *Copy To…*, Explorer drops, shortcuts,
  the SFX/link/batch-wrapper operations, help and `config.reg` under an accented
  install path, `$(SalDir)`, the cloud entries (all three producers — the
  "OneDrive-specific" framing was refuted), the external archivers (**both**
  directions of the OEM boundary in one change, because they cancelled each
  other), volume/subst/label information with the Drive Information template
  (one commit — two of its rows render correctly *only* while their arguments
  stay code-page bytes), shares, the viewer's default conversion and caption,
  and the ZIP overwrite line. Two fixes were made **differently from the
  finding's own suggestion** after tracing the consumers: `CCodeTablesData::Name`
  is *not* re-encoded (those bytes reach plugins through
  `EnumConversionTables`, and `dbviewer`/`filecomp` persist them), so the
  viewer's stored default is repaired in the lookup instead; and the help chain
  moves as a whole (producer + search + `HtmlHelpW`), with the wide help call
  guarded because `dwData` may carry an ANSI topic/keyword/`HH_FTS_QUERY` from a
  plugin. New shared helpers: `SalU8TrimIncompleteTail` (drops a *torn* trailing
  UTF-8 sequence and leaves a complete character alone — the obvious version of
  this eats an accented last character) and `SalU8ToOEM`/`SalOEMToU8` for the
  archiver console boundary. Guard: `signed-char-name-byte` retired (its premise
  is void under `/J`) in favour of `acp-byte-table-on-name`, which is now the
  cluster B-2 work list (33 hits); `acp-title-seed` added and proven; strict
  stays `TOTAL: 0`, draft 183 → 148. saltests 1257 → **1289**. Plugin ABI
  untouched (interface 106). **Process**: four independent regression reviews,
  **two REJECTED** and corrected — a progress title blanked in five languages,
  and a half-converted chain that would have made the shell copy a stray
  `DROPFAKE` folder because the ANSI shell extension could not recognise the
  name. Deferred with written reasons, not dismissed: the five systemic clusters
  B-1–B-5, nine named sites (incl. `icncache.cpp`'s icon location and the
  DROPFAKE pair), and six newly found defects — the first of which,
  `codetbl.cpp:873`, is a one-byte buffer overflow and should be fixed first.
  Handoff: `specs/069-finish-encoding-fixes/REMAINING-WORK.md`; record:
  `closing-report.md`.
- 068-encoding-regression-review: product-wide review of encoding handling
  (the whole core, not one release delta) after feature 067 showed a defect in
  a surface earlier features were believed to cover. Seven charted perspectives
  inventoried 2,529 candidate sites across 8 boundaries; **76 findings raised,
  60 confirmed** by independent refute-first verifiers (8 refuted, 4 latent,
  2 by-design, 2 withdrawn). **9 fixes**, each accepted by a third agent that
  did not write it: command-line stack overrun (261-byte buffer vs a 765-byte
  name), taskbar jump list (ANSI `IShellLink` → mojibake *and* wouldn't open),
  per-drive remembered directory lost each restart, disk-cache/temp cleanup
  dead under a non-ASCII `%TEMP%` (incl. the `RemoveTemporaryDir` plugin
  service), rubber-band over-selection, a **regression feature 052 itself
  introduced** (`dialogs5.cpp:495`), ZIP overwrite prompt, filecomp blank
  title. Guard `tools/check_encoding.py` gains 3 strict rules (9 total), each
  **proven to fire** on a planted defect; 4 stay report-only behind deferred
  fixes; `signed-char-name-byte`'s premise is void — the product compiles
  with `/J`. saltests 1229 → **1257**. Plugin ABI untouched (no
  `src/plugins/shared/` or forwarder diff; interface 106).
  **Deferred with evidence, not dismissed** — 6 systemic clusters, each
  feature-sized: 88 of 90 dialogs are ANSI windows (non-ACP input becomes `?`
  and is *persisted* by Change Directory / Find / user menu), ACP byte tables
  behind all name comparison (`Č.txt` != `č.txt`), the undocumented UTF-8
  `GetErrorText` (~27 plugin sites; a naive sweep would *regress* FTP),
  `AlterFileName` (also drives Change Case, which renames on disk), the
  plugin-facing ANSI services (FR-009 freeze), and the remaining facade
  migration. Report: `specs/068-encoding-regression-review/review-report.md`.
- 059-fix-onedrive-syncing-badge: the sync-in-progress badge (blue arrows)
  now shows as in Explorer. Windows exposes cloud state through two
  channels; folders in a pending state are claimed by NO overlay handler
  (all seven OneDrive `IsMemberOf` return S_FALSE) — Explorer draws them
  from `PKEY_StorageProviderState` (documented "Property for the cloud file
  state icon"), which the overlay-only pipeline never read (missing since
  Open Salamander). Fix: property fallback in
  `CShellIconOverlays::GetIconOverlayIndex` — only when every handler
  declined AND the panel path is under a CFAPI sync root
  (`CfGetSyncRootInfoByPath`, cldapi.dll dynamic; `G:` letter drives are
  not CFAPI → unchanged); states {4,5,6,10} map to the synthetic overlay
  `TandemCloudSyncPending` (own icon `src/res/syncpend.ico`, generator
  `tools/brand/gen_overlay_syncpend.py`; disable-able via the existing icon
  overlay config). `GPS_DELAYCREATION|GPS_BESTEFFORT` keeps content
  property handlers from running (no hydration, no failures on malformed
  documents). Integration exposed + fixed a latent upstream RTC bug:
  uninitialized `HRESULT res` in `GetIconOverlayIndexAuxAux` when a reader
  slot is NULL. `cfapi.h` cannot be included at `_WIN32_WINNT=0x0601` —
  the two needed ABI-stable declarations are mirrored locally.
- 071-configurable-command-shell: the **Command Shell** command (`Num /`,
  `Ctrl+/`, Commands menu, toolbar button — one handler, `CM_DOSSHELL` →
  `CMainWindow::OpenCommandShell` in `src/cmdshell.cpp`) opens a user-chosen
  program: presets *Command Prompt* (default = the old `%COMSPEC%` launch,
  bit-for-bit), *Windows PowerShell*, *PowerShell 7*, *Windows Terminal*
  (`-d .`), *Git Bash*, or a *Custom* program + arguments (`$(FullPath)` = panel
  directory **without** a trailing backslash, root excepted — the User Menu
  *Initial Directory* meaning, table `CommandShellArgsExpArray` in
  `execute.cpp`; `$[ENV]`). Preset table + locate algorithm live in
  `src/common/salshell.*` behind an injectable probe (52 saltests checks with a
  fake machine; PowerShell 7 is looked up alias/MSIX first because its MSI is
  being phased out). Setting = 3 values under `Configuration` (`Command Shell
  Preset|Program|Arguments`), no config-version bump. New Configuration page
  *Command Shell* (`IDD_CFGPAGE_CMDSHELL`, `CCfgPageCmdShell`) inserted after
  *Hot Paths* — the hard-coded `mode == 3` page index in
  `CConfigurationDlg` moved 21 → 22; not-found presets are marked and refused
  on OK; empty Custom fields pre-fill from the previous preset. Encoding:
  `SalGetEnvVarU8` (wide env read) now also serves the shared `$[ENV]`
  expansion in `DoExpandVarString`; new `SafeGetOpenFileNameW` for the
  Browse button; launch errors composed from `LoadStrU8` with a Help button
  to the new manual topic `configuration_cmdshell.htm` (first help page
  authored after the rebrand: "Tandem Commander" + "© 2026 Pavel Stupka";
  the other 236 pages still carry the 2023 Open Salamander footer — a
  separate follow-up). Known/kept: `SalCreateProcess` never forwarded
  `lpTitle` (since feature 004) — untouched; Windows refuses a starting
  directory ≥ 259 chars for every program — the launcher retries with the 8.3
  form. Translations: `ui-overrides.json` pins make the page name follow each
  language's existing *Command Shell* menu term (cs "Příkazový řádek", de
  "Eingabeaufforderung", fr "Interpréteur de commandes", nl "Opdracht Shell",
  ro "Comanda Shell", sk "Príkazový riadok") and keep the corpus' formal
  register. GUI matrix (quickstart §3–§6) is a human step; see
  `specs/071-configurable-command-shell/fix-log.md`.
- 072-winget-distribution: Tandem Commander is published to the **Windows
  Package Manager** catalogue as `PavelStupka.TandemCommander` (moniker
  `tandemcommander`), so `winget install tandemcommander` / `winget upgrade`
  work - the product's first update path. The catalogue stores no binary, only
  three YAML manifests pointing at the GitHub release asset and pinning its
  SHA256, so publishing = a pull request to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`. Tooling in
  `tools/winget/`: the **templates are the source of truth** for all catalogue
  metadata (authoring comments are stripped on generation, so submitted
  manifests stay conventional - consequence: no line inside a YAML block scalar
  may start with `#`), and one entry point `publish.ps1` (Windows PowerShell
  5.1, `sign_release.ps1` tier) derives the version from
  `setup/tandemcommander.iss`, the release date **and release notes** from
  `CHANGELOG.md`, downloads the published asset, **verifies its Authenticode
  signature against `tools/codesign/codesign.cfg`**, hashes it, renders,
  `winget validate`s, and with `-Submit` hands the directory to `wingetcreate`.
  `.github/workflows/winget-publish.yml` runs the same script on
  `release: published` (pre-releases skipped) and degrades to
  generate-and-validate when `secrets.WINGET_PAT` is absent - the first
  workflow in the repository to use a secret. **No product file changes
  behaviour**: the plan called for adding `commandline` to
  `PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed` in `tandemcommander.iss` so winget could
  pass `/ALLUSERS` / `/CURRENTUSER` in a silent install, plus a version gate
  keeping older releases from advertising a scope they could not honour. Both
  were **refuted by testing and removed**: Inno Setup enables the command-line
  scope switches for the `dialog` override mode too, which the installer has
  always had - a probe with the installer's exact privilege configuration
  installed per-user silently with no elevation. So `=dialog` stays (plus a
  comment: **do not narrow it, winget depends on it**), and 0.1.5 already
  offers **both** scopes. What replaces the gate is an invariant check -
  `publish.ps1` refuses to generate if that directive is missing, so the
  manifests can never advertise an install mode the installer would reject.
  `MinimumOSVersion: 10.0.19041.0` states what the binaries can run on
  (`_WIN32_WINNT=0x0601`), not the Windows 11 the project markets; winget
  refuses to install below it. `ProductCode` is the Inno key `{AppId}_is1` and
  must move with `AppId` or upgrade detection silently breaks. Real installs,
  the workflow run and the first (irreversible, public) submission are manual -
  see `specs/072-winget-distribution/quickstart.md` and `fix-log.md`.
- 075-fix-small-hardening: closed the six defects that were **recorded but not
  fixed** — the five from `069/REMAINING-WORK.md` §3 (which feature 069's own
  charter forbade it to touch, having no finding behind them) plus the Code
  Viewer test-runner note from 074. One commit per defect, each independently
  reviewed: `CCodeTables::GetCodeName` (**two** overflows, not the one recorded
  — a name of exactly the caller's buffer length wrote one byte past it *and*
  an unbounded `convert.cfg` name overran a 1024-byte stack scratch; one
  bounded `lstrcpyn` replaces both), the viewer's coding-menu default read
  before it was set, a NULL conversion name faulting inside the plugin-facing
  `GetConversionTable`, the viewer title torn mid-character on paths over 259
  bytes (the one user-visible item), the File Comparator's unbounded header
  copy, and `run_tests.cmd`'s Node-version-dependent verdict
  (`--experimental-detect-module`; detection is the default from Node **22.7**,
  not 22.12). **Plugin ABI untouched** — no `src/plugins/shared/` diff,
  interface 106, `saltests` unchanged at 1353/0 by design (contract C14: none
  of the sites is reachable from a test exe that links only `src/common/`).
  **Process, and the reason to keep it**: the independent review REJECTED the
  File Comparator fix — its walk-back ran unconditionally and ate the last
  character of an *untruncated* code-page name, reachable because
  `fcremote.exe` is an ANSI build — while the build, the tests and the evidence
  probe were all green; the same trap had been written into the *viewer title's*
  design hours earlier and simply not applied. Reviews also corrected three
  factual claims in the feature's own records. Evidence: a committed probe
  (`specs/075-fix-small-hardening/probe/`) compiling the verbatim pre- and
  post-fix bodies in canary arenas, 37 checks — its first two failures were
  fixture bugs, and after each review it gained the fixture class that would
  have caught what the reviewer found. **Still owed**: the GUI scenarios S1–S5
  and gate G6 need a person; this session could not drive the application or a
  debugger, which is recorded rather than worked around. No version bump, no
  changelog entry yet — the text is drafted in `fix-log.md` for the ship gate.
- 077-fix-antivirus-findings: implements findings 3.2 and 3.3 of the 076
  antivirus false-positive review (`specs/076-avast-false-positive-review/`).
  **(a) The Visual C++ runtime ships application-locally**: every shipped
  module links the CRT dynamically but no release ever carried
  `vcruntime140.dll`, `vcruntime140_1.dll`, `msvcp140.dll`, `concrt140.dll`;
  on a machine without the redistributable the installer finished and the
  program failed with "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found" (the likely "problem
  with the installation" of the user report). `build.cmd release` (full and
  incremental) now calls `src/vcxproj/copy_vc_runtime.cmd` (redist version
  from `VC\Auxiliary\Build\Microsoft.VCRedistVersion.default.txt` of the
  `vswhere`-located VS, no absolute path) and then
  `tools/check_runtime_deps.py`, a stdlib PE import-table closure check that
  fails the build if any shipped PE imports a runtime DLL missing from the
  tree root; the installer packages the tree recursively and needed no
  change. `tools/codesign/sign_release.ps1` exempts validly Microsoft-signed
  files (never re-signed, `Exempt (Microsoft): 4`) and refuses a
  runtime-named file without a valid Microsoft signature (contract:
  `specs/077-fix-antivirus-findings/contracts/signing-exemption.md`, amends
  050 section 1). **(b) The in-process kernel32 patch is gone**:
  `callstk.cpp` no longer rewrites `kernel32!SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` in
  memory (`VirtualProtect` + `WriteProcessMemory` trampoline, an inline-hook
  pattern behaviour shields flag); the filter is registered normally and
  `CallStk_ReassertTopLevelExceptionFilter()` re-registers it from the
  15-second `IDT_ADDNEWMODULES` timer (`AddNewlyLoadedModulesToGlobalModulesStore`).
  `WriteProcessMemory`/`VirtualProtect` left the import table. Verified
  twice each: builds, checker negatives, loaded-module origin
  (`probe/check_loaded_crt.ps1`), crash parity with a cdb-injected fault
  (`probe/crash_inject.ps1`, app + zip.spl; the injected thread must be the
  window-owning one, woken by `WM_NULL` after `.detach`; with a debugger
  attached the registered filter is never called), re-registration under a
  breakpoint (`probe/reassert_filter.ps1`), signing sweep + negative
  (`probe/sign_exempt_negative.ps1`), silent per-user install/uninstall,
  saltests 1353/0. **Found on the way, out of scope**: `salmon.exe` loads
  `dbghelp.dll` only from its own `utils\` directory, which is not shipped,
  so no minidump has ever been produced in any release (text report only);
  and an old bug report left in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tandem Commander\` makes
  salmon offer it at start-up while the main thread blocks in
  `SalmonCheckBugs`. **Owed human step**: the literal start on a clean
  Windows without the redistributable (Windows Sandbox / VM, admin needed).
  Record: `specs/077-fix-antivirus-findings/fix-log.md`.
