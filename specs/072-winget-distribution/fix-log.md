## The one real correction: the installer needed no change at all

The plan's D6 was built on a premise that turned out to be false.

**Assumed**: Inno Setup accepts `/ALLUSERS` and `/CURRENTUSER` only when the
installer is compiled with `PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed=commandline`.
`setup/tandemcommander.iss` had `=dialog`, so the plan added `commandline` and
introduced `$UserScopeSinceVersion = '0.1.6'` to keep already-released versions
from advertising a scope they could not honour.

**Found**: Inno Setup documents permitting the install-mode dialog as *also*
enabling the command-line parameters. `=dialog` alone already accepts both
switches, and it has been in the installer script all along.

**Evidence** — probe installers compiled with Inno Setup 7 and run silently:

| Probe configuration | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `PrivilegesRequired=lowest`, `=dialog` | `/VERYSILENT /CURRENTUSER` | exit 0, installed per-user |
| `PrivilegesRequired=lowest`, `=dialog` | `/VERYSILENT /ALLUSERS` | switch **honoured** - tried to elevate, blocked on the UAC prompt (2 min timeout), nothing installed. Not ignored, not rejected. |
| **`PrivilegesRequired` unset (admin), `=dialog`, `{autopf}` — the exact configuration of `tandemcommander.iss`** | `/VERYSILENT /CURRENTUSER` | exit 0, installed into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\<AppName>`, **no elevation**, `HKCU` uninstall key `{AppId}_is1` written |

All probes were uninstalled through their own uninstallers; no directory,
registry key or Start Menu entry was left behind, and the user's own
machine-wide Tandem Commander 0.1.5 installation was never touched.

**Consequences**:

- `setup/tandemcommander.iss` is back to `PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed=dialog`.
  It gains only a comment recording that this directive is what winget relies
  on, so nobody narrows it.
- The version gating is gone: `$UserScopeSinceVersion`, the
  `#@REQUIRES_CMDLINE_SCOPE_*` fences and the block-stripping pass in
  `Render-Template` were all removed. `publish.ps1` lost about 20 lines.
- **0.1.5 offers both scopes**, so per-user installation is available from the
  first submission rather than the next release.
- What replaces the gating is a check on the thing that can actually go wrong:
  `publish.ps1` refuses to generate if `PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed` is
  missing from the installer script. Proven by commenting the directive out —
  the run fails with the intended message, and nothing is written.

Recorded because the mistake is instructive: the boundary would have shipped
correct manifests for the wrong reason, and would have delayed a working
feature by a release.

## First submission

Opened 2026-08-29 for **0.1.6**, not 0.1.5: 0.1.6 is the release whose
CHANGELOG and README announce winget, and it was published while this feature
was still in progress.

- Pull request: **microsoft/winget-pkgs#426038**
- Installer SHA256 `88AEE5CF60B3459D59979D1A3C01FF9AF7CA8C38EABC18D167773924CE2841CB`,
  8 002 608 bytes, signature verified against `codesign.cfg` before generating
- CLA signed on the pull request (one-off; later versions do not need it)
- Checks 01 Pull Request Validation, 02 Manifest Validation, 03 URLs
  Validation, 04 URL Domain Validation, 06 Catalog Content Verification and
  `license/cla` green; 05 Manifest Policy Validation **neutral**, which is the
  expected outcome for a new package rather than a failure; 07-10 running at
  the time of writing
- Labelled `New-Package`, so it waits on a human reviewer

**Manifest schema 1.10.0 was accepted** by check 02, although the pull request
template mentions 1.12 — the concern noted during implementation was unfounded.

The `manifests/0.1.5/` directory was removed: it was generated while building
the tooling, was never submitted, and keeping it would suggest a release that
never reached the catalogue. The verification runs recorded below were made
against it and stand as written.

## 0.1.7 passed the catalogue's validation

microsoft/winget-pkgs#426090, opened automatically by the workflow when the
v0.1.7 GitHub release was published. **All checks green**, awaiting a human
reviewer (`New-Package`; "Merging is blocked / Review required" is the normal
state for a new package, not a fault).

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| 01 Pull Request Validation | 12s |
| 02 Manifest Validation | 10s — schema 1.10.0 accepted |
| 03 URLs Validation | 24s |
| 04 URL Domain Validation | 13s |
| 05 Manifest Policy Validation | neutral — expected for a new package |
| 06 Catalog Content Verification | 29s |
| 07 Installers Scan | 3m |
| **08 Installation Validation** | **32m — the check that failed twice** |
| **09 Installer Metadata Validation** | **21s — ran for the first time** |
| 10 Validation Completed | 10s |
| license/cla | met (signed once, on #426038) |

Two of these settle open questions. **08** confirms the `WizardSilent` fix was
the right diagnosis: the same manifest shape that failed twice now installs
unattended. **09** had been skipped on every previous attempt, because 08's
failure cut the run short — it compares what the installer actually writes to
Add/Remove Programs against `AppsAndFeaturesEntries`, so the `ProductCode`
`{35C0B0DC-DB73-429C-AAA8-FBC41C937F66}_is1`, `DisplayName`, `Publisher` and
`DisplayVersion` are now verified rather than assumed. That is what
`winget list` and `winget upgrade` rely on.

The installer hash the workflow published,
`6731E14611B18C42B5AF268A03AA379F34E5332231DA8E1B602A99B5875F64DD`, is
byte-identical to the one generated locally from the same asset.

## Root cause: the installer could not be installed silently

Two rounds of Installation Validation failed on
microsoft/winget-pkgs#426038 before the cause was found, and the first
explanation was wrong. The record is kept in order because the way it went
wrong is the lesson.

**Round 1.** Two installer entries — `Scope: machine` with `Custom: /ALLUSERS`
and `Scope: user` with `Custom: /CURRENTUSER`. Checks 01–07 and 10 passed, 08
Installation Validation failed after 6m37s, label `Validation-Shell-Execute`,
09 skipped as a consequence.

**Wrong diagnosis.** The per-user entry was blamed: the pipeline runs manifests
elevated (winget-pkgs issue 72224), so `/CURRENTUSER` would land in the
administrator's profile and not be found. Plausible, consistent with the label,
and it matched T017 — the assumption the plan had already flagged as
unverified. The entry was removed and the package resubmitted machine-only.

**Round 2 failed identically**, which refuted it.

**Actual cause, proven.** Running the published 0.1.6 installer with the
switches winget uses, from an elevated shell:

```
EXIT CODE: 1
Failed to proceed to next wizard page; aborting.
Caught EAbort exception.
```

The AI disclaimer page added in feature 050 keeps the *Next* button disabled
until its checkbox is ticked. A silent install still traverses the wizard's
pages even though it displays none of them, so Setup met a button it could not
press and aborted. **Unattended installation had never worked** — `git tag
--contains` puts the page in every release from v0.1.0 to v0.1.6. Nobody
noticed because the installer had only ever been run by hand.

Confirmed by a pair of probe installers differing in one line:

| Probe | Exit | Log |
|---|---|---|
| as shipped | 1 | `Failed to proceed to next wizard page; aborting.` |
| `and not WizardSilent` | 0 | `Installation process succeeded.` |

**Fix.** `setup/tandemcommander.iss`, one guard in `CurPageChanged`, shipped in
**0.1.7**. Interactive behaviour is unchanged; a silent install skips the page
as it always skipped the licence page. 0.1.6 cannot be salvaged: the manifest
pins the SHA256 of the published asset, and replacing a released binary is not
acceptable. PR #426038 is closed and the submission remade for 0.1.7.

**What this cost, and why.** Twice a plausible theory was acted on instead of
the failure being reproduced first. The reproduction — running the installer
with winget's own switches — took under a minute and gave the answer
immediately; it should have been the first step after round 1, not the third.
The `Validation-Shell-Execute` label was read as evidence for a specific
mechanism when it only means "the installer handler failed".

Two further notes on the first round. The per-user entry was submitted with
T017 openly recorded as an *unverified assumption*, in the pull request that
also had to get a brand-new package accepted; and it had entered the design as
an option raised during clarification, not as part of the request. Whether a
per-user entry actually works is **still unknown** — the real defect masked it.

**User-facing texts were wrong too, briefly.** `--scope user` had been promised
in `README.md`, in the `CHANGELOG.md` entry for 0.1.6 and in the release notes
already published on the GitHub release page. All three were corrected.

## Workflow, verified in production

Both halves of the automation proved themselves on 2026-08-29 without being
staged for it.

**Run #1 fired by itself** when the v0.1.6 GitHub release was published, at a
point when `WINGET_PAT` did not yet exist. It finished green having generated
and validated the manifests and submitted nothing — exactly the intended
degradation. Had that guard not worked, `winget-pkgs` would have received a
second pull request for 0.1.6 alongside the manual one, for a moderator to
close.

**Run #2** was the deliberate `workflow_dispatch` dry run with `submit`
unchecked. It settled three things that had been unverifiable locally:

- the GitHub runner **can** validate the Certum certificate chain — the
  Authenticode check passes there, so a signed release is not rejected in CI;
- `winget` **is** available on `windows-latest`, so the schema is validated on
  the runner too. The "winget is not available here" fallback was written on
  the opposite assumption and stays as a safety net, not as the normal path;
- the run produced `SHA256 88AEE5CF...41CB`, byte-identical to the local run
  and to the submitted manifest.

Consequence to remember: with the secret now in place, the **next** published
release submits on its own. Running `publish.ps1 -Submit` by hand afterwards
would open a duplicate pull request; the script is the fallback for when the
workflow fails, not a second channel.

## Verification results

**Generation for 0.1.5** (quickstart §1) — passed.

```
 Version       : 0.1.5
 Release date  : 2026-08-25          (from CHANGELOG.md, not typed)
 Installer     : GitHub release (6 844 176 bytes)
 SHA256        : 0B41E35A0C86AD5CB7C10F6D5C99BEBBE32B907F47A2A1BFFD4884AC8D1C36D5
 Scopes        : machine + user
Manifest validation succeeded.
```

The downloaded asset and the local `setup\output\` copy hash identically, so
the published file is the signed build in the tree.

**Signature gate** (quickstart §2) — passed, both paths:

- `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` (5 MB, Microsoft-signed) →
  `ERROR: the installer is signed by an unexpected certificate (CN=Microsoft Windows, ...)`
- a 455 KB executable → `ERROR: the installer is only 454656 bytes - wrong file?`

In both cases `manifests\0.1.5\` was left untouched: the check runs before
anything is written.

**Installer-directive guard** (quickstart §3) — passed. With the directive
commented out, the run fails with
`ERROR: setup\tandemcommander.iss has no PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed ...`
and exits 1. The file was restored and `git diff` shows only the added comment.

**Inno Setup accepts the file** — a probe compiled cleanly with Inno Setup 7,
confirming the added comment breaks nothing. The real installer was not
recompiled, deliberately: that would overwrite
`setup\output\tandemcommander-0.1.5-x64-setup.exe`, which currently matches the
published asset byte for byte and is what the manifests are hashed against.

**YAML** — the workflow and all three generated manifests parse.

## Decisions taken while implementing

**Two schema errors, found by `winget validate` on the first run** (T007):

1. `InstallerSuccessCodes: [0]` — the schema explicitly forbids `0`; success is
   implicit. The key was dropped entirely.
2. The locale field for documentation links is `Documentations`, not
   `Documentation`. Recorded in the contract §6 so it is not re-introduced.

**No `ElevationRequirement` on the user entry** — the plan proposed
`elevationNotRequired`, which is not a value the schema defines (the enum is
`elevationRequired` / `elevationProhibited` / `elevatesSelf`). Omitting the
field is also the correct behaviour: `elevationProhibited` would make winget
refuse a per-user install requested from an elevated console, which is legal,
just profile-bound.

**Comments are stripped from generated manifests.** Submitted winget-pkgs
manifests conventionally carry only the schema line. Keeping the rationale in
the templates and stripping it on generation lets the templates be as
explanatory as they need to be. The trade-off, recorded in contract §6: no line
inside a YAML block scalar may start with `#`.

**Release notes come from the changelog.** The lead paragraph of the version's
`CHANGELOG.md` section is flattened to one paragraph (Markdown emphasis, links
and inline code removed; typographic dashes and quotes folded to ASCII; capped
at 900 characters) and becomes `ReleaseNotes`, so `winget show` says what
actually changed instead of pointing at a URL.

## Deviations from the plan

- **D6 was refuted and rewritten** — see the section above.
- The plan's file layout put a `package.cfg` next to the templates, mirroring
  `tools/codesign/codesign.cfg`. Dropped: almost every value here is stable and
  belongs with the field it fills, so the templates are the single source of
  truth and there is one file fewer to keep in step.
- `-LocalFile` proved more useful than planned: it is how the signature gate
  was tested without a matching release existing.

## Open items

- **T010 and T017 are manual** and cannot be run from here: they install
  software and need an administrator shell. Commands are in
  [quickstart.md](quickstart.md). T014 is done — see *Workflow, verified in
  production* above.
- **T017 also validates an assumption** that testing could not settle here:
  that winget adds no scope switch of its own for `inno` installers that would
  displace `InstallerSwitches.Custom`. If `--scope user` were to install
  per-machine, the switches must move to the `Silent` / `SilentWithProgress`
  fields.
- **T021 is done** — see *First submission* below.
- **tandemcommander.org** still needs the same *Installing* wording as
  `README.md`; that lives outside this repository.
- Both the CHANGELOG entry and the README section state availability as
  following Microsoft's acceptance, so neither claims something untrue in the
  days between the release and the merge.
- **Upgrading while the application is running aborts the install.** Found
  while verifying the 0.1.7 fix: with Tandem Commander open, a silent install
  logs "RestartManager found an application using one of our files" followed
  by "Some applications could not be shut down", and `/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES`
  answers the resulting Abort/Retry/Ignore prompt with **Abort** - exit code 5,
  changes rolled back. Practically, `winget upgrade` fails for anyone who has
  the program open. The catalogue's validation installs on a clean machine so
  it is unaffected, and it does not block the submission. The fix belongs in
  the application: respond to the Restart Manager's shutdown request
  (`WM_QUERYENDSESSION` / `RegisterApplicationRestart`) so Setup can close it.
  Worth a feature of its own.
- Not in scope, but now cheap: `checkver` could be redirected at the GitHub
  Releases API, or dropped in favour of `winget upgrade`.

## Moderation feedback on #426090: DisplayVersion removed (2026-09-30)

After a month in moderation, the reviewer's automation (*"Deterministic
automation - build 1820"*) set `Needs-Author-Feedback` on
microsoft/winget-pkgs#426090 with one request: *"This manifest uses the same
values for DisplayVersion and PackageVersion. This is not recommended, and the
DisplayVersion should be removed."*

It is redundant for this package: Inno Setup writes `AppVersion` as the
Add/Remove Programs `DisplayVersion`, and `AppVersion` is `MyAppVersion`, which
is also what `publish.ps1` renders as `PackageVersion`. When
`AppsAndFeaturesEntries` omits `DisplayVersion`, winget matches the installed
entry against `PackageVersion`, so `winget list` / `upgrade` see the same
thing. `DisplayName`, `Publisher` and `ProductCode` stay.

- `templates/installer.yaml.in`: the `DisplayVersion: {{VERSION}}` line is
  gone and an authoring comment records why - add it back only if the two
  versions ever differ. This is the one exception to "change nothing under
  `templates/` while #426090 is open": the moderator asked for it, and the
  next submission (0.1.8) must not bring the line back.
- `manifests/0.1.7/`: regenerated with `publish.ps1 -Version 0.1.7` (asset
  re-downloaded, SHA256 unchanged `6731E146...F64DD`, Authenticode verified,
  `winget validate` succeeded); the only difference is the removed line.
- The pull request's files were written by `wingetcreate` and differ from ours
  in formatting (list indentation, key order, header comment) but not in
  content - compared field by field - so the PR is updated by deleting the
  same single line from its `installer.yaml`, not by resubmitting.

## Moderation feedback on #426090: Description without brand names (2026-10-06)

The moderator (Stephen Gillie), 2026-10-06: *"I believe the Policy 1.2 check
might be due to the several brands mentioned in the Description. Could it be
rewritten to exclude these?"* - label `Needs-Author-Feedback` set again.

What the submitted text named: Norton Commander, Open Salamander and Altap
Salamander (ancestry), WinAPI, 7-Zip and RAR among the archive formats (ZIP,
TAR, ISO beside them), and the command shell presets Command Prompt,
PowerShell, Windows Terminal and Git Bash. `ShortDescription` named Open
Salamander; the tags `explorer-replacement`, `open-salamander` and
`salamander` carried product names too.

Policy and precedent, checked first: policy 1.2 (Security) says nothing about
names; the applicable texts are 1.1 (metadata must "accurately and clearly
reflect the source, functionality, and features") and 2.2 (names in metadata
must be the provider's own, licensed, or "used as otherwise permitted by
law"). Merged file managers describe themselves in one or two neutral
sentences (Total Commander, Far Manager, Files: no other product named;
Double Commander: one, *"inspired by Total Commander"*). Naming the origin is
therefore not forbidden, but the request was explicit, so it is left out of
the three fields; the `Copyright` line keeps "portions (c) Open Salamander
Authors" (attribution, not description).

- `templates/locale.en-US.yaml.in`: `ShortDescription` and `Description`
  rewritten to say what the program does (every claim true of 0.1.7 - command
  shell page and Code Viewer came with 0.1.6); the three tags removed (13
  left); an authoring comment records the rule for later versions. Format and
  protocol names (FTP, SFTP, Markdown, Unicode) and the platform stay.
  `InstallationNotes` still names the WebView2 runtime - an install
  instruction, not asked about, unchanged.
- `manifests/0.1.7/` locale file: the same lines edited **by hand**, not
  regenerated - the template has since gained `PrivacyUrl` (feature 083),
  which the pull request does not carry, and this push was to change only
  what was asked. Parsed field by field, the archived file equals the file on
  the pull request. `winget validate`: *Manifest validation succeeded* for
  both.
- Pull request: one additional commit on the head branch of the fork,
  `a64404beef4c096fdfa42ace774328bcc371a4af` ("Rewrite Description without
  third-party brand names"), locale file only (blob `1a1da94e`); installer and
  version files byte-identical to the previous head `a6cf23e74`.
- **Not done by the session**: the reply on the pull request. The GitHub CLI
  is not installed on this machine (the push went through git's own stored
  credential); the comment is the maintainer's step.
